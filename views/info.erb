<h1>Hello and welcome to Joe's games.</h1>


<body>    


<p> 
Let me tell you alittle about myself. I was born in Morgantown W.V. and lived in Nemacolin Pa for the first few years of life, where after we moved to Akron, Ohio.    <br>
Shortly after we moved to Stow Ohio where i went to school there until my 6th grade year when we moved back to Carmichaels pa. I graduated from Carmicheals Area.      <br>
Jr/Sr High in 2003, while in Highschool I studied Computer Information Technology at Greene Co Votech. When I graduated from Highschool I went to Daytona Beach where  <br>
I studied Computer Engineering at Daytona Beach Community College. When my brother, sister inlaw & their kids wanted to move to Arizona to be closer to her family they<br>
asked me to come with them, so I said Why not?.I lived for a few years in arizona working on cars and as a laboror. So after a few years there I moved back here to    <br>
Greene County Pa. In July 2015 I heard how <a href="http://minedminds.github.io" target="_blank">Mined Minds</a> was offering FREE programming courses so of course <br>
I took them up on their offer, which I'm so glad I did as this has been such a great learning experience.<br><br>
